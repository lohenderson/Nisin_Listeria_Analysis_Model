# Nisin Listeria Analysis Model
This code is used to model the effects of temperature and pH on *Listeria monocytogenes'* sensitivity to nisin on a lab-scale cheese model. 

## How to use

Raw data: Cheese_Nisin_Masterfile.csv

Note: Day 1 data represents the counts obtained after 1 day of incubation. The data obtained and included in the inoculum column represnets calculated day 0 data.

Code: Nisin_Listeria_Analysis_Model.R

We constructed two linear mixed effects models for **temperature** and **pH** using the "lmer" function in the "lme4" R package. For each model:

Response: log of the number (log_count) of *L. monocytogenes*

Random effects: 
- replicates (rep)
- plate nested within cheese make and milk batch

Fixed effects:
- temperature or pH
- day
- phage
- strain
- age of the milk (milk_age)
- log of the aerobic plate counts (bacterial counts in the milk before cheese was made; milk_apc)
- inoculum (log cfu/g of *L. monocytogenes* inoculated on each cheese)

We also included interactions between the following fixed effects:
- nisin and temperature or pH
- nisin and strain
- nisin and day

A one-way ANOVA was calculated for the effect of pH on nisin extracted from the whey.

Raw data: SoftAgarDiffusion.csv

Code: SoftAgarDiffusion.R

A two-way ANOVA was calculated for the effect of strain and pH of *L. monocytogenes* log reduction for experiments using the mutant strains. Post-hoc analysis was performed using Tukey's HSD.

Raw data: NisinMutants_LogReduction.csv

Code: NisinMutants_LogReduction.R
