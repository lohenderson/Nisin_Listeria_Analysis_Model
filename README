# Nisin Listeria Analysis Model
This code is used to model the effects of temperature and pH on *Listeria monocytogenes'* sensitivity to nisin on a lab-scale cheese model. 

## How to use

Raw data: Cheese_Nisin_Masterfile.csv

Note: Day 1 data represents the counts obtained after 1 day of incubation. The data obtained and included in the inoculum column represnets calculated day 0 data.

Code: Nisin_Listeria_Analysis_Model.R

We constructed two linear mixed effects models for **temperature** and **pH** using the "lmer" function in the "lme4" R package. For each model:

Response: log of the number (log_count) of *L. monocytogenes*

Random effects: 
- replicates (rep)
- plate nested within milk batch

Fixed effects:
- temperature or pH
- day
- phage
- strain
- age of the milk (milk_age)
- log of the aerobic plate counts (bacterial counts in the milk before cheese was made; milk_apc)
